# First_Aid_Kit_Device
The Smart First Aid Kit is an Internet-of-Things based healthcare safety system designed to ensure that emergency medical supplies are always available. The system senses when the first-aid box is opened and tracks medicine quantity inside the kit. If the medicine level becomes low or someone accesses the kit, the user receives a real-time alert on their smartphone.

This project supports emergency preparedness in homes, schools, offices, hospitals, and public areas.
